# Linear-Programming-Model-to-maximize-profits

A Optimization model has been built following the constraints and using Excel Solver.
 The table below describes how much each of the products will 
cost the company (including transportation costs): 
 
Item Cost (in Dollars) 
Pressure washer 330 
Go-kart 370 
Generator 410 
(Case of 5 Water Pumps) 635 

 
 
The company has set aside a purchasing monthly budget of $170,000 for the new location. The selling 
prices (per unit) for each item are given in the table below:           
 
Item Selling Price (in Dollars) 
Pressure washer 499.99 
Go-kart 729.99 
Generator 700.99 
Water pump 269.99

Other than the budget, another of the company’s concern is the available space in the warehouse. The 
warehouse has 82 shelves, and each shelf is 30 ft long and 5 ft wide. Pressure washers and generators 
each are stored on 5 ft by 5 ft pallets whereas each Go Kart is stored on an 8 ft by 5 ft pallet. 
Furthermore, a 5 ft by 5 ft pallet is used to store four cases of water pumps 
For promoting its brand products, the company’s marketing department has decided to allocate at least 
30% of its inventory to pressure washers and Go Karts and sell at least twice as many generators as 
water pumps. 
Perform a monthly analysis using a linear programming model to maximize the company's net profit.
